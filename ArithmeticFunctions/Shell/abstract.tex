\begin{abstract}
The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic overview of several computational techniques that have emerged in connection with Project Euler problems involving arithmetic functions. While these methods were initially developed and discussed within the private Project Euler forums, accessible only to users who have solved the corresponding problems, many of them were subsequently examined in publicly available discussions. 
The latter 
\cite{DirichletConvolutionPart, nisiyamaTutorialMathNotea, nisiyamaTutorialMathNote}, will constitute the primary sources for this exposition.
